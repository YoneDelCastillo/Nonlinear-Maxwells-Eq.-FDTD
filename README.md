My name is Yone del Castillo Berm√∫dez, 
this work is part of my Bachelor's final project at University of Granada, during de academic course 2023-2024.

You are free use my code and improve it, but I will be greatful if you cite my work.

All code was written by me based on Yee's algorithm and Allen Taflove's book "Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method". 
The thesis and code are written in Spanish but I will translate them into english at some moment in future.

Hope you find it useful, thank you for reading this.

Yone
